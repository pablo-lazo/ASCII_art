to hell and back - Symphony X

I have led the lamb into the slaughter
Ice flowed through my veins
I was my own worst enemy, still hellish memories remain
I have shown the serpent into the garden
And wore the mask of Cain
Take a look in these eyes, where the past evil lies
And feel my pain
Oh, the hell's hounds drawing near
And my conscience isn't clear
I'm the one who whispered the words to Judas
I'm the hangman's noose
Though I try to repent, in a valiant attempt
It's no use
I'm the judge, the jury, the executioner
Oh, the things I've seen
With an eye for an eye, kill the man, kill the past, kill the dream
Oh, the hell's hounds drawing near
And my conscience isn't clear
I've been to hell and back
And I can't justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die, I'm learning to fly
Under the moonlit glow, I just can't let it go
Words spoke in vain, now fall like a silent tear
As shades dance by candlelight, in the dead of night
And all of the things I yearn slowly disappear
And now there's nothing here
Riding the storm, heading for a fall
I curse you all, be damned
Through the haze, the sword that cuts both ways
A line is drawn in the sand
Ironbound, a will as cold as steel
To conquer all and divide
Striking with an iron fist of will
I will not be denied
On and on and on... No quarter asked, no quarter given
On and on and on... Never forgotten or forgiven
Thunders rise from the terror's eyes
Scorched by a heart drenched in black
No return, I will watch it burn
Now there's no turning back
On and on and on... No quarter asked, no quarter given
On and on and on... Never forgotten or forgiven
On and on and on... No quarter asked, no quarter given
On and on and on... Never forgotten or forgiven
I've been to hell and back
And I can't justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die
I've been to hell and back
And I can't justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die, I'm learning to fly
